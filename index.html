      The 2016 Presidential election is many months away, just under 18 months to be exact. Even though the big day is so far away, the news cycles are dominated by coverage on this very topic. It is remarkable that current events are pushed out of the way for this event so many months down the road. The 2016 election will be a historic one and in some respects the coverage is justified. <br>
      On the right the field is shaping up as one littered with more canidates than one can even begin to remember. However, on the left there is really only one canidate, thus far, to see the campaign to the final stages. This is none other than Hillary Clinton. <br>
      Therefore, concidering the singular face and voice of the Democratic Party, I pose one question to you. Will you vote for Hillary in the 2016 Presidential Election?
